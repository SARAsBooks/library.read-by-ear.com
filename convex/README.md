# Convex Integration - Phase 1 Complete

This directory contains the Convex backend implementation for the Read-by-Ear library application.

## Phase 1 Implementation Status âœ…

### Completed Features

1. **Convex Packages & Initialization**

   - Installed `convex` and `@convex-dev/auth` packages
   - Set up `convex/` directory with proper structure
   - Created `convex/tsconfig.json` for TypeScript support

2. **Schema & CRUD Functions**

   - `schema.ts`: Defined tables for libraries, learningRecords, and preferences
   - `library.ts`: CRUD operations for reading libraries and bookmarks
   - `learning.ts`: Learning record tracking and batch operations
   - `preferences.ts`: User preferences and sync settings

3. **Client Integration**

   - `src/lib/convex/client.ts`: Convex client with auth.sara.ai integration
   - `src/lib/convex/hooks.ts`: Typed React hooks (placeholder implementation)
   - `src/lib/convex/sync.ts`: Sync utilities and session helpers
   - `src/components/ConvexProvider.tsx`: Conditional provider wrapper

4. **Feature Flag Implementation**
   - Added `useConvex` flag to Session type
   - Updated `librarys.ts` observable with conditional sync logic
   - Graceful fallback to legacy server actions when Convex unavailable
   - Environment-based configuration via `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL`

### Key Architecture Decisions

- **Local-first preservation**: Convex integration doesn't break existing functionality
- **Feature flag driven**: Users can opt into Convex sync via `useConvex` session flag
- **Auth integration ready**: Placeholder auth token generation for auth.sara.ai
- **Graceful degradation**: App works without Convex URL configured

## Next Steps (Future Phases)

### Phase 2: Complete Integration

- Run `npx convex dev` to generate `_generated/` API files
- Update placeholder hooks with actual generated types
- Implement real auth.sara.ai JWT token generation
- Test real-time sync functionality

### Phase 3: Learning Records Migration

- Integrate learning records with Convex working set
- Maintain PostgreSQL as audit trail
- Test fluency calculation performance

### Phase 4: Production Readiness

- Performance optimization and conflict resolution
- Offline queueing and error handling
- Cross-device sync testing

## Development Notes

- The implementation includes TypeScript-safe placeholder functions
- All Convex functions include TODO comments for auth validation
- ESLint disable comments are used for placeholder any types
- Build passes successfully with feature flag system in place

## Configuration

Add to environment variables:

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL=https://your-convex-deployment-url
```

When `NEXT_PUBLIC_CONVEX_URL` is not set, the app gracefully falls back to legacy sync methods.
